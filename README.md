# Solution of Business Objective

1. We have find out the Top 20 neighbourhoods where number of booking is high, we can focus on those areas for marketting campaigns and advertisements for maximize booking and reduce marketting cost by redcing the focus areas.

2. Most of the guests doesn't prefer shared rooms rather choose entire home/apt and private room. Manhattan and Brooklyn are most demanded neighbourhood groups.

3. The average stays in Entire home/apt, Shared room and Private room are 8, 6 and 5 days approx. resp. Get to know the average number of booking for respective room type in a month.

4. Most subscribed booking price is come within the bracket of $10-400 where almost 95% booking happens as well as most reviews are also given by these guests. One more thing Private room and Entire home/apt gives most number of reviews.

Maximum listings done by a top hosts are also concentrated in Manhattan and Brooklyn like higher prices and most bookings.

We can say that hosts are also inclined to Manhattan and Brooklyn due to higher price realisation and more booking as we know from earlier charts; so we can ask more comission from hosts here and realise more profit.

# Conclusion

The people who prefer to stay in Entire home or Apartment they are going to stay bit longer and same is the most booked room type in the Neighbourhood group.

The findings from an exploratory data analysis project on Airbnb can help both hosts and guests make more informed decisions. Hosts can learn more about what amenities guests are looking for and how to price their property competitively. On the other hand, guests can follow some parameteres to make decisions about the location, amenities, and price of properties they want to book.
The given Airbnb Dataset has vast data but lacks in some required features because it is not easy to decide property valuation. Overall, conducting an exploratory data analysis project on Airbnb can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the short-term rental market and enhance the user experience for both hosts and guests.
